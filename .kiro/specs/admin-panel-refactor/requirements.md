# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive refactoring of the admin panel application to fix TypeScript issues, improve API handling, create reusable components, and implement better code organization practices. The refactoring will focus on creating a centralized API layer, implementing proper form validation with Formik, organizing interfaces, and optimizing the overall codebase structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors to be resolved, so that the codebase is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors
2. WHEN API responses are handled THEN the system SHALL properly type the response data structures
3. WHEN form data is processed THEN the system SHALL enforce proper type constraints for status fields and other enums
4. WHEN components receive props THEN the system SHALL validate prop types at compile time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized API layer with proper error handling, so that API calls are consistent and maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use a centralized doFetcher function
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them consistently with proper error messages
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL properly unwrap the response data structure
4. WHEN authentication tokens are required THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in requests
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for base URLs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all interfaces and types organized in separate files, so that they can be easily imported and reused across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining data models THEN the system SHALL store interfaces in dedicated type files
2. WHEN components need type definitions THEN the system SHALL import them from centralized type files
3. WHEN API response types are needed THEN the system SHALL have generic response wrapper types
4. WHEN form data types are required THEN the system SHALL have properly typed form interfaces

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate API function folders for different entities, so that API calls are organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing API functions THEN the system SHALL create separate folders for each entity (applications, users, accounts, rights)
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use entity-specific API modules
3. WHEN adding new API endpoints THEN the system SHALL follow the established folder structure
4. WHEN API functions are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable form components using Formik with proper validation, so that forms are consistent and have inline error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating forms THEN the system SHALL use Formik for form management
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display inline error messages
3. WHEN form fields are invalid THEN the system SHALL show validation messages in real-time
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL prevent submission if validation fails
5. WHEN creating new forms THEN the system SHALL reuse common form components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized and reusable components, so that the codebase follows DRY principles and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL extract common functionality into reusable components
2. WHEN components share similar logic THEN the system SHALL create custom hooks for shared behavior
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling patterns
4. WHEN components handle loading states THEN the system SHALL use reusable loading components
5. WHEN components display data THEN the system SHALL use reusable data display components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and loading states, so that the application handles errors gracefully and provides good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components encounter errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect users appropriately
5. WHEN components fail to load THEN the system SHALL show fallback UI

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code patterns and best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing components THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices
2. WHEN handling state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management patterns
3. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent folder structure
4. WHEN naming variables and functions THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions
5. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript annotations
